# LoreItemTooltips
hi this is very early version

this adds flavour text to most of the items (in Retail) I could find in the following zones:

Azuremyst Isle
Bloodmyst Isle

Eversong Woods
Ghostlands

Hellfire Peninsula (Horde)
Zangarmarsh (Horde-WIP)

Eversong Hawkstrider Mounts
Azuremyst Elekk Mounts

# installation
download the thing, open the .zip, place LoreItemTooltips into the WoW/Interface/Addons folder, remove the `-master` part of the folder name. should be good to go.
There's no curseforge version uploaded yet because I'm going to be updating this addon internally very often. It might take a bit to push to github.
