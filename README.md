# LoreItemTooltips
hi this is very early version

this adds flavour text to most of the quest items (in Retail) I could find in the following zones:
<details>
	<summary>Burning Crusade:</summary>
  
  Azuremyst Isle
  
  Bloodmyst Isle
  
  Eversong Woods
  
  Ghostlands
  
  Hellfire Peninsula (Horde)
  
  Zangarmarsh (Horde-WIP)
  
  Eversong Hawkstrider Mounts
  
  Azuremyst Elekk Mounts
  
</details>

# installation
download the thing, open the .zip, place LoreItemTooltips into the WoW/Interface/Addons folder, remove the `-master` part of the folder name. should be good to go.
There's no curseforge version uploaded yet because I'm going to be updating this addon internally very often. It might take a bit to push to github.

# commands
I almost forgot to add this so yeah there's 2 main commands

/lit will bring up the colour picker to change the colour of the custom flavor text on items, you can also do /loreitemtooltips or /loreitemtooltip incase another addon breaks that because I know my own addon technically overwrites Legion Invasion Timer's /lit so yeah oops

/litreset will reset the colour back to the default yellow, but it'll also tell you the previous colour you had chosen in case you didn't want to actually reset so you can choose the colour values again. You can also do /loreitemtooltipsreset or /loreitemtooltipreset but that's pretty verbose. I'm probably going to change it to /loretooltip later and shorten it to /ltt or maybe /litt or something idk.
